# *Post-hoc* Explainability for Time Series Classification: Towards a Signal Processing Perspective


### Overview 

The figures in the paper can be reproduced using the associated notebooks as in the following table:


* **Figure 2**: The notebook `classifier_comparison-plot_results` plots the figures according to the data in `data/accuracies.pkl` and `data/complexity.pkl`. This data is collected using the notebook  `classifier_comparison`.
* **Figure 3**: See the notebook `Figure_3` for the code to generate both subfigures.
* **Figures 4, 5, 6**: See the notebook `Figure_4_5_6` for the code to generate those figures.
* **Figure 7**:
* **Figure 8**:
